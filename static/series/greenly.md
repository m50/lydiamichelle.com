# Greenly

Greenly is here to dissect the strange and intrusive thoughts that accompany a person suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. These commonly comorbid conditions are stereotyically thought of as a physical manifestation of worry, anxiety, depression, and uncontrolled thoughts and behavior. These challenging conditions come with a unique side effect; intrusive thoughts overwhelm, attack and drain the mind of reason in episodes, many times visually. The real sensations that come with powerful manifestations of fear is the main focus of this series, where I show just a view of some challenges that have invaded daily living.

From the obvious "*To Touch a Table*" portraying the fixation on the physical worry that comes with touching surfaces, to "*Diodon Hysterix*" that showcase the complex 'pricks and pringles' from intrusive sensations, Greenly silently matches compulsion to canvas (even the title, Greenly, is a tribute to my personal tic with words of specific pronunciation).
