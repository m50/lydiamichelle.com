    title: Epona's Defenders
    blurb: Gaelic and Roman Goddess of horses and donkeys, as well as a symbolic
      character if fertility, Epona was said to help us travel to our final
      destinations after death. This illustrative oil work is inspired by her
      character and those who may have been alongside her journeys.
